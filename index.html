		<h2>Student Visa Consultancy Firm in Bangladesh</h2>
		<p>Student Visa Consultancy firms have seen a potential growth in Bangladesh due to an increasing number of students aspiring to go abroad for higher education. Many qualified students leave hope to achieve their dreams merely because they do not have proper knowledge on oversees education. <i><b>Consultancy firms can play the most important role to serve YOU proper knowledge and assist YOU to get admission and visa</b></i>. However, not every consultancy firm can make your dreams come true. Even, some can make YOU confused and misguided with fabricated information. Therefore, if YOU are on searching for a visa consultancy firm to genuinely help YOU, make sure YOU search for a firm you can rely on because of its transparent service and previous success rates.</p> 

		<p><b>Career Paths</b> <i>is one of the student consultancy firms helping Bangladeshi students with a number of services including visa assistance</i>. The firm doesn’t persuade the students telling the popular false stories, e.g. “We have 100% Visa success rate” or “Guaranteed Visa”. Rather it truly says that we can assist YOU at best to secure admission and visa and also offers students to visit its office to come up with a career building decision. Among many, we help students with career counseling, admission assistance and visa assistance. <b>Career Paths</b> always calls itself a helping-hand in study visa assistance. Therefore, it doesn’t want to see YOU a financial looser and thus discourages YOU for a worthless investment on a file having slim chances to get your admission and visa. In addition, Career Paths doesn’t charge YOU for merely file opening, doesn’t tell YOU to send application fee if there is a refusal possibility and warn YOU not to proceed further.</p>

		<h2> Message from Chairman</h2>

		<p>I feel privileged and proud to note message as the chairman of an education consultancy firm which achieved trust from both prospective students and World-leading Universities.

		<h2><b>Career Counselling</b></h2>
		<p> If you plan on living and getting degree from university in oversees, YOU must want, after having degree, to have a rewarding career as well, Right? Unfortunately, most of the students fail to do so. The reason is very simple- ignorance about choosing programme, institution and country. Though simple reason it is not as simple as it sounds. The selection of three different issues requires vast knowledge and skill on oversees education. If YOU do wrong in selecting any of the issues, be sure, YOU will suffer even if YOU can reach your dream country. We, at Career Paths, do the hard work but with ease that’s been possible because of our previous experiences and skilled counselors.</p>

        <p>More importantly, Career Paths considers YOU as ‘THE’ student rather than ‘A’ student. That means it focuses on individuals’ competency and thus proceeds towards.

        <h2><b> IELTS/Language Development</h2></b>

In many cases, fluency in English speaking during interview at Embassy/High Commission determines the possibility of getting visa. So, YOU as our student do not need to go outside for such a help.
